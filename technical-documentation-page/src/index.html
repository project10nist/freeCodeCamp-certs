    <p>This chapter introduces you to the mind mapping software application Freemind (version 0.8.0). It provides an overview of the application and explains the general features of Freemind. You will learn about installation and configuration, installation prerequisites, and usage techniques.</p>
    <ol>
      <li class="item-title">Introduction to Freemind</li>
        <p>Freemind is an open source, mind-mapping software program written in Java. A mind map is a knowledge organization tool used to elicit ideas from one or more users by placing a topic in the center of an empty space and branching out with related ideas.</p>
         <p>The general premise of mind-mapping software is that it will help you to organize, link, and integrate thoughts. The primary focus of a mind map involves making an arrangement of words into a picture, which has a key concept at the centre or at the top, and related words and concepts linked with the key concept by means of lines and arrows.</p>
        <p>Mind mapping software can be used for brainstorming and conceptualizing, where you have ideas you need to put down, structure, expand, and connect. Freemind also works as a tree editor. You can create foldable trees of plain text notes enriched with colors, icons, cloud-shapes, and other graphics. This will help you to customize your map. For example, you can use clouds to group together the nodes that are interrelated, colors to differentiate between completed tasks and other tasks, and icons to prioritize a node.</p>
        <p>Freemind is useful for organizing your ideas and for keeping track of all the things that are involved in completing a task. You can use Freemind to keep a personal knowledge base that is easy to manage. You can take advantage of the scientific method and write-everything-down approach in your daily life. Freemind is a valuable and effective tool for people who want to manage themselves systematically.</p>      
      <li class="item-title">What Freemind is good for</li>
        <p>Current users of Freemind use it for the following purposes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Projects: Freemind helps you in keeping track of projects including subtasks, state of subtasks, and time recording.</li>
          <li>Information: Freemind helps you in managing information including links to necessary files, executables, and source of information.</li>
          <li>Internet Research: Freemind helps you in performing internet research using Google and other sources.</li>
          <li>Knowledgebase: Freemind helps you in keeping a collection of small or middle-sized notes with links on some area, which expands as needed. Such a collection of notes is sometimes called a knowledge base.</li>
          <li>Essay: Freemind helps you in writing essays and brainstorming your ideas, using colors to show which essays are open, completed, not yet started etc, using size of nodes to indicate size of essays.</li>
          <li>Database: Freemind helps you in keeping a small database of something with structure that is either very dynamic or not known in advance.</li>
         <li>Internet Favorites: Freemind helps you in maintaining commented internet favorites or bookmarks, with colors and fonts having the meaning you want.</li>
